[pmi2-init-failed]
PMI2 failed to initialize, returning an error code of %d.
We cannot use PMI2 at this time, and your job will
likely abort.
#
[pmi2-init-returned-bad-values]
PMI2 initialized but returned bad values for size and rank.
This is symptomatic of either a failure to use the
"--mpi=pmi2" flag in SLURM, or a borked PMI2 installation.
If running under SLURM, try adding "-mpi=pmi2" to your
srun command line. If that doesn't work, or if you are
not running under SLURM, try removing or renaming the
pmi2.h header file so PMI2 support will not automatically
be built, reconfigure and build OMPI, and then try again
with only PMI1 support enabled.
