[static-and-dynamic]
Both static and dynamic port ranges were specified for the
out-of-band (OOB) communication subsystem:

Static ports:   %s
Dynamic ports:  %s

Only one can be specified. Please choose either static or
dynamic ports and try again.
#
[include-exclude]
Both TCP interface include and exclude lists were specified:

  Include: %s
  Exclude: %s

Only one of these can be given.
#
[not-parseable]
The specified network is not parseable. Since we cannot determine
your desired intent, we cannot establish a TCP socket for out-of-band
communications and will therefore abort. Please correct the network
specification and retry.
#
[no-included-found]
None of the TCP networks specified to be included for out-of-band communications
could be found:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[excluded-all]
The specified list of networks to be excluded for TCP out-of-band communications
resulted in no networks being available:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for oob_tcp_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s
#
[no-loopback-found]
WARNING: No loopback interface was found. This can cause problems
when we spawn processes as they are likely to be unable to connect
back to their host daemon. Sadly, it may take awhile for the connect
attempt to fail, so you may experience a significant hang time.

You may wish to ctrl-c out of your job and activate loopback support
on at least one interface before trying again.
#
[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your Open MPI job will likely hang until the failure resason is fixed
(e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes available), and may
eventually timeout / abort.

  Local host:     %s
  Errno:          %d (%s)
  Probable cause: %s
